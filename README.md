# dotfiles
This project hosts my dotfiles for my Mac installation. It was highly inspired by [Dries Vints'](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).

## Getting started

1. Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
2. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
3. Install macOS Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install`
4. Copy your public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh` and make sure they're set to `600`
5. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`
6. Install [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#getting-started)
6. Run `install.sh` to start the installation
7. After mackup is synced with your cloud storage, restore preferences by running `mackup restore`
8. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> Note: you can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Just make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) file.
